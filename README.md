# Object Detection
Solving object detection problems using TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Python

Object detection is a subfield of computer vision that focuses on identifying and locating specific objects withing digital images or videos. It involves not only classifying the objects present in an image but
also determing their precise location and size by placing bounding boxes or other spatial encodings around them.
